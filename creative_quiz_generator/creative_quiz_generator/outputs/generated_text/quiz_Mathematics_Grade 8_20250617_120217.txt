Generate a Short Answer quiz for a Grade 8 student with 5 questions on mathematics. Include: none.

1. What is the value of the digit 5 in the number 357.628?

Answer: 50

Explanation: The value of a digit in a number depends on its position. In this case, the digit 5 is in the ten-thousandths place, so its value is 5/10,000 or 0.0005. However, since the question asks for the value of the digit, we can express this as 50 (times ten-thousandths).

2. Simplify the expression: 3x + 2y - 4x + y.

Answer: -x + 3y

Explanation: To simplify the expression, we need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable and exponent. In this case, we have two like terms with x and two like terms with y. We can combine them as follows:

3x + (-4x) = -x

2y + y = 3y

So the simplified expression is -x + 3y.

3. If a rectangle has a length of 8 cm and a width of 5 cm, what is its area?

Answer: 40 square centimeters

Explanation: The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, the length is 8 cm and the width is 5 cm, so the area is:

Area = length x width
Area = 8 cm x 5 cm
Area = 40 square centimeters

4. Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 11.

Answer: x = 4

Explanation: To
